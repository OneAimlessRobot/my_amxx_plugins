Name: (My) Chikoi the Maid.<br>
Type: (Pocket sized) Maid.<br>
Age: ???? (F)<br>
Height: 135cm.<br>
Weight: 27kg.<br>
Desc: Chikoi is very, very very very very very very very small. She has a light blue, bowl cut, Blue eyes, and her face is almost constantly displaying a smile. Her attire is a classic looking apron, beheath is a orange classic, simple dress, she has a red snood. Also a white, body sized apron and... a 'tiara' on her head. No jewlery. She dances after every task she completes, by jumping and spazing out all over the place while not uttering a single sound, without uttering anything, just gasping faintly at the effort she exerts. She is also as strong as her size allows so... she makes coffee, tea... and not much more. No one knows her true age. Or who are her parents. She seemingly just spawned into existence... already dressed in that inconic attire, and with that smile on her face. Her eyes are big. her face is roundy and can jump very high for her height.<br>
Her personality... is unscreenable. Does she have PDs? Any traits? Cognitive type? Tastes?..... passions? Purpose? She just accepts orders and gets really happy when she gets them right and sad when she gets them wrong. Thats all.<br>
She thinks, every day: "I cant be big and strong because I am a small maid"<br>
Also... the dances that she performs are mostly just...<br>
Spazzing and skipping around chaotically without uttering anything but aerobic-related reflexes from the effort... like gasps during slight changes in flow and panting when she is done... which is the moment she then goes back to staying completly still.... waiting for more instructions.<br>
Dont get me wrong like...<br>
People *did try* to teach her how to dance...<br>
But...<br>
she always goes back to spazzing around like some sort of neurological-firmware triggered by a sensor in a homemade PCB...<br>
Some professionals who looked into her...<br>
Even think that this behaviour<br>
Is basically imprinted into her nervous system...<br>
She biologically cant unlearn it...<br>
Theoretically...<br>
If she ran out of calories half way through the dance... she would just collapse like an old 14-key cellphone with low battery<br>
<br>
