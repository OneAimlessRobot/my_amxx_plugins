cs16server_adventures<br>
<br>
<br>
ok,<br>
I made some heroes and plugins for cs 1.6<br>
And I am even hosting a server<br>
(I will send you a photo with my setup shortly)<br>
And its very fun!<br>
The problem...<br>
Is that I am not very good...<br>
At this game.<br>
Yeah...<br>
Even bot_difficulty 3 zbots are a problem for me.<br>
And I know its me who is bad,<br>
Because...<br>
When I struggle,<br>
It does not feel like "Omg Just hang in there ghnnn--!" sort of struggle.<br>
its more "Ewwghhh... Hmmphh!<br>
this is so awkw--<br>
Oh...<br>
There I go again...<br>
Im dead, I guess..."<br>
But it is fun!<br>
I have a hero that is based on lena where,<br>
She gets an awp.<br>
Thats it.<br>
An AWP.<br>
The problem?<br>
Is that this awp:<br>
1- only has 4 bullet clips<br>
2- shoots projectiles which:<br>
Drop with gravity<br>
obey air drag<br>
do less damage based on how much speed they lose.<br>
And the holster time is really annoying!<br>
<br>
(projectile headshots are really satisfying, though)<br>
