I have another based on flora,<br>
(which is kind of useless because the bots dont care about render transparency lol.<br>
She creates fields,<br>
BEcomes invisible when crouched within them,<br>
And can teleport between fields if they are close together enough.<br>
Also...<br>
She syphons health from enemies who get within the field.<br>
Assuming flora is [already] withn some field.<br>
<br>
And...<br>
The healing makes her glow.<br>
Not that it would matter,<br>
As the bots dont care about rendering lol)<br>
<br>
I have ANother her based on ksun,<br>
A character I dont think ive shared yet.<br>
She gets:<br>
1- sleep grenades.<br>
2- an m4. (Plain ol m4)<br>
3- she can cast spores <br>
which follow enemies and...<br>
Ok ksun is too hard to explain I think I might just share code examples)<br>
<br>
<br>
another hero is actually based on the yandere archetype.<br>
She is a selfless yandere which heals teamates<br>
And also gets more damage and speed.<br>
The more teamates alive,<br>
the more she heals.<br>
The less teamates alive,<br>
the more damage she deals<br>
And the less she heals.<br>
WHen alone against the enemy team,<br>
She turns into super yandere,<br>
Who gets 1000hp automatically,<br>
1/4 of gravity,<br>
A super shotgun which has heal on hit,<br>
A psychosis superpower which grants her no knockback,<br>
And supercharged heal on hit,<br>
Super yandere mode also gives her a voodoo doll knife which,<br>
WHen used to stab an enemy while in super yandere mode,<br>
If that same enemy hits her on that same life,<br>
There is a chance the curse will kick in,<br>
WHich will grant the player who got cursed with [death].<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is not exaustive.<br>
<br>
<br>
its really fun but...<br>
Meh...<br>
I kinda suck, haha!<br>
<br>
[sigh...]<br>
<br>
I wish people played with me.<br>
But Im too trauma-coded to ask for people to join.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh.<br>
<br>
This is all for Cs 1.6 with AMXMODX, by the way.<br>
<br>
I obsessively hunt for bugs most of the time I am logged in,<br>
Restating it over,<br>
ANd over again as to reload the plugins that I recompile.<br>
<br>
But other times...<br>
I try to enjoy the finished product.<br>
And the game [is] fun!<br>
<br>
I...<br>
I just kinda suck, meh<br>
