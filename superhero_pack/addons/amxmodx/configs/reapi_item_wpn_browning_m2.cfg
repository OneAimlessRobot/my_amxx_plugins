//******************************** MAIN CVARS ********************************//

// Status of the plugin.
//
// Available values:
//   0 - Disabled.
//   1 - Enabled, only admins can spawn a M2.
//   2 - Enabled, all the clients can spawn a M2.
//
// Default value: "1".
item_wpn_m2_status 1

// Set the maximum limit of M2s on the map.
//
// Default value: "2".
//
// Notes:
//   Set to 0 to disable this option.
//   Also keep in mind there is an internal limit which is defined at 5% of the maximum entities the server can support.
item_wpn_m2_limit_total 2


//******************************* BUYING CVAR ********************************//

// Cost of a M2 ($).
//
// Default value: "15000".
item_wpn_m2_cost 15000


//****************************** SETTINGS CVARS ******************************//

// Health of a M2.
//
// Available values:
//                  0 - Invulnerable.
//   <positive value> - Health set at spawn and as "maximum".
//
// Default value: "1000".
item_wpn_m2_health 1000

// Initial damage of a M2.
//
// Default value: "300".
//
// Notes:
//   Do not forget this weapon is using a .50 BMG caliber, so it's normal for me to have such big value as base, knowning such caliber is much more powerful (3x more energy) than the .338 Lapua Magnum used by the AW/M sniper.
//   Also, this damage will be modified (multiplied), when you hit a specific hit zone as the head (* 4), etc., so yes, the final damage can reach very high value, like +1200!
//   That's a Browning M2!!!!!!!! Not a Super Soaker for kids & pussies!
item_wpn_m2_bullet_damage 300

// Rate of fire in number of shots per second.
//
// Default value: "8" (real value of a M2, which is around 500 RPM).
//
// Note: The rate of fire is usually exprimed "in minutes", so feel free to multiply/divide per 60 to have your values.
item_wpn_m2_fire_rate 8

// Spread types.
//
// Available values:
//   0 - No spread, the precision of each shot is perfect.
//   1 - Small random spread, the precision is not perfect.
//   2 - Medium random spread, the precision is very not perfect.
//   3 - Large random spread, the precision is very very not perfect.
//   4 - Extra-large random spread, the precision is horrible!
//
// Default value: "1".
item_wpn_m2_spread_type 1

// Penetration system: Limit of successive hit points (walls/entities) each bullet can penetrate.
//
// Available values:
//       -1 - No limit of penetration (this will penetrate anything until there is no more "thing to penetrate".
//            Note: But this is internally limited to 32 as safety.
//      0|1 - No successive penetration.
//   2<->32 - Maximum number of successive penetrations.
//
// Default value: "-1".
//
// Note: This system allows to add realistic penetration (mainly in conjunction with the following CVar), a way much better than the default CS's weapons which are not "thickness based".
item_wpn_m2_penetration_num -1

// Penetration system: Factor of penetration.
//
// Default value: "0.15".
//
// Notes:
//   This is a factor coefficient used to determinate the "penetration power" of each bullet (despite the M2 actually does not fire real bullets/entities).
//   This factor is multiplied by the current damage passed at an impact zone (entity, wall, etc.), and at the end, you got a "maximum penetration power in units" the system can use.
//   So for example, with an impact damage of 300, this does "300 * 0.15" so 45 units can be penetrated inside the element hit.
//   If in case the thickness of an impact zone is higher than our penetration power, the bullet will not pass at through it and will not touch the following entities.
//   Also, when it "exit" an impact zone, the current damage is obvious lower than before, and the "penetration power" for the next impacts will be lower.
//
//   Keep in mind the system in this plugin is "basic", despite it's cool to have such, but I'm mainly using a "looping trick" with the "CBaseEntity::FireBullets" function.
//   And it does not consider yet the "penetration power according to texture type", except for clients and monsters where it's a bit adjusted.
//   But in overall, it does the job fine enough for now.
//   But on "a future AMX Mod version", there will be powerful natives of that kind, easy to use and with more possibilities.
item_wpn_m2_penetration_factor 0.15

// Pitch range in degrees.
//
// Available range: 0<->180.
// Default value: "40".
//
// Notes:
//   The "pitch range", is the vertical/frontal range on which one you can move the gun, more you increase it, more you can shoot vertically (and turn a bird into pieces of meat!).
//
//   The range starts from the middle/center (initial barrel position) to the top/down, it's not the range from top to down.
//   So for example, if you specify 90 as range, the vertical/frontal "FOV" of the barrel is in fact 180 degrees.
item_wpn_m2_pitch_range 40

// Pitch rate.
//
// Default value: "120".
//
// Note: The "pitch rate", is how fast the gun can be moved on the vertical/frontal range.
item_wpn_m2_pitch_rate 120

// Yaw range in degrees.
//
// Available range: 0<->180.
// Default value: "120".
//
// Notes:
//   The "yaw range", is the horizontal/lateral range on which one you can move the gun, more you increase it, more you can shoot laterally (and make the mistake to kill yourself!).
//
//   The range starts from the middle/center (initial barrel position) to the left/right, it's not the range from left to right.
//   So for example, if you specify 90 as range, the horizontal/lateral "FOV" of the barrel is in fact 180 degrees.
item_wpn_m2_yaw_range 120

// Yaw rate.
//
// Default value: "180".
//
// Note: The "yaw rate", is how fast the gun can be moved on the horizontal/lateral range.
item_wpn_m2_yaw_rate 180

// Disable/Enable the removal of all the M2s at some major events.
//
// Available values:
//   0 - No global removal.
//   1 - Remove the M2s only when the round is restarted (via the CVars "sv_restart[round]").
//   2 - Remove the M2s at the end of each round.
//
// Default value: "2".
